So before starting the Data Cleaning Process:

1] Whenever the bhavcopy file is downloaded, please change the name of the file to;

                                        bhavdata.csv

and paste it in both the files to Data Cleaning 'OPT' and 'FUT', one copy each.

2] Go to each file that is Data Cleaning 'OPT' / 'FUT'.

3] Open both the notebooks from each file, each one of CE and PE of FUT and OPT repectively.

4] Set in the dates according to your liking in the cell where you find [EXPIRY_DATE], where above that there is
the variable dates and change the dates accordingly.

5] Lastly, when done all of the above steps, then click on the play button on the top in the middle of the screen
which says 'Run the Selected Cells and Advance', although remember to keep the cursor pointer in the first cell.
